## Creating an admin user

In order to create a user, you must navigate to the IAM dashboard, this can be done by searching IAM in the search bar of the home console. 

Once in the IAM dashboard, navigate to the **users** section by selecting it on the left side of the page:

From here you will see a button labelled "Add users"

After clicking the add user button, you will see a menu which prompts you to enter the details of the user you want to create. 

For this admin user, I will be using a custom password for access but there are also auto-generated password, and access keys as options for security.

For the next step, I will create an "admin" group which will give users assigned to this group administrative permissions.
After completing the user details page and clicking the "permissions" button you will be automatically asked if you want to create a group or use an existing one.

One you click on "create group", you will be shown this interface where you can name your group and assign premade policies, which includes administrator access.

The next step of creating a user will be to assign tags, which are simply information that helps you track and organise AWS resources. You dont have to create a tag, but an example of a tag you could add is one with the key of "department" and value which is the name of the department this user works in. 

After tags, you will see a review screen which shows you all the details you have added to this user so you can check if everything is right, and if it is, create user.

Once the user is created, the site will tell you to download the `.csv` which will contain the security credentials of the user you created. This is userful when using autogenerated passwords as that is where you will find the password.

To login with the new account, you need to copy the url given to you on the home IAM dashboard in a new browser window.
