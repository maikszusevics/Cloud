# Disaster Recovery

Disasters can happen for any reason and are not predictable. If you do not have a disaster recovery plan, it could permanently wipe out your data.

You can lower tha chances of this by:
- Having your own local backups (Hybrid Cloud)
- Having your data stored on multiple AZs, for example eu-west-1a, and eu-west-1b and 1c. If one of these datacentres goes down, your data will still be safe in the other locations.
- Having data stored accross multiple regions
- Deploying your data across multiple cloud service providers. This is very expensive but It's neccesary for situations where very sensitive data is being stored, such as government records or bank details.
