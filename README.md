# Sparta guidelines for AWS usage

- AWS naming convention for services - group_person_task - for example - eng122_Shahrukh_ec2

- When not in use (09:00 - 18:00) terminate. It costs money to run. Ask if you want to run out of hours, so that it can be authorised.

- for the duration of this course ensure you are logged in in Ireland - Europe (Ireland) eu-west-1.

- Do not delete anyone else's services

- DO NOT share AWS account details or keys with anyone - so don't push them to github
